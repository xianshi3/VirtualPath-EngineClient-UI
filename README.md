## Project Overview

This project is a cross-platform desktop drawing application built on the Avalonia UI framework using C#. It integrates high-performance OpenGL rendering and employs a modern MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to deliver a flexible, extensible, and user-friendly experience. The application supports multiple custom drawing services, providing a dynamic and personalized interface layout with rich interactive capabilities.

## Key Advantages

### 1. Flexible Modular Architecture

> Utilizes the MVVM pattern to clearly separate UI from business logic, enabling loosely coupled and independent modules.  
> Drawing services are abstracted via interfaces, allowing seamless switching and extensibility for various rendering strategies, facilitating future feature growth.

### 2. High-Performance Graphics Rendering

> Integrates custom OpenGL renderers supporting advanced features such as Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA).  
> Users can dynamically balance visual quality and rendering performance.

### 3. Modern Interface and Intuitive Interaction

> Employs a dark theme with a clean, card-style layout that is both professional and visually appealing.  
> The bottom control panel provides real-time adjustment of parameters such as rotation angle, scale, 和 3D position, ensuring smooth and intuitive user interaction.

### 4. Strong Extensibility

> Designs with abstraction and interface-driven development enable easy addition of new drawing services, rendering features, or interactive components to meet diverse and evolving user requirements.

### 5. Dynamic and Personalized Layout

> Users can freely adjust sidebars, dialogs, 和 main rendering areas to create a personalized workspace that improves efficiency and suits individual workflows.

### 6. Integrated Intelligent Interaction Models

> Supports embedding AI-based conversational generation models to enhance interactivity and deliver intelligent assistance, promoting advanced human-computer collaboration.
